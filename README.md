This file outlines the proposed architecture for a Museum of Internet History web application using Flask as the backend framework and a relational database for data storage.

>>> Database Schema

The database will consist of several tables:

Memes (id, name, image_url, description, origin_date, category, format)
Events (id, name, description, date, impact)
Users (id, username, email, bio, avatar_url)
Content (id, user_id, content_type, content_text, content_url, timestamp) (Content type can be "meme", "comment", "forum_post")
Comments (id, content_id, user_id, comment_text, timestamp)
Reports (id, content_id, user_id, reason, timestamp)

>>> Flask Routes and HTTP Methods:

GET /timeline - Returns JSON data for timeline events.
GET /memes - Returns paginated results of memes with search and filter options.
GET /memes/<meme_id> - Returns detailed information for a specific meme.
GET /events/<event_id> - Returns detailed information for a specific event.
GET /forums - Returns a list of forum categories.
GET /forums/<category_id> - Returns a list of forum threads within a category.
GET /forums/threads/<thread_id> - Returns details and comments for a forum thread.
POST /memes - Allows users to upload and submit their own memes. (Requires user authentication)
POST /comments - Allows users to post comments on memes, forum threads, and informational pages. (Requires user authentication)
POST /reports - Allows users to report inappropriate content.
POST /users - User account creation.
PUT /users/<user_id> - Allows users to edit their profile information. (Requires user authentication)
DELETE /comments/<comment_id> - For moderators to delete flagged comments. (Requires moderator privileges)

>>> Route Interaction with Webpage Functionality:

The Flask routes will serve JSON data or HTML templates depending on the request type. Javascript on the frontend will handle user interactions, make AJAX requests to the Flask routes, and update the webpage content accordingly. The database will be accessed through the Flask backend to store, retrieve, and update information.

// Note: Actual implementation will involve additional functionalities such as user authentication, authorization, error handling, and security measures.
